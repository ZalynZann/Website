        <div class="date">Local Sponsorship Services</div>
        <div class="title"></div>
        <div class="descr">One of the challenges is navigating the legalities and processes required to launch a business in the UAE. International company owners in Dubai may operate with ease by teaming up with UAE nationals as business partners. According to UAE Commercial Companies Law and UAE Civil Law, a local sponsor's contribution is necessary for the foundation of a UAE business. In other words, in order to run a company on the mainland, an expat business owner requires a UAE citizen sponsor. The local sponsor is either an Emirati national or a business that is fully controlled by Emiratis. The local sponsor may also perform the duties of an LSA, or local service agent. The local service agency must receive a yearly fee from the foreign investor. </div>
